# **Group Assignment 2: Development Trading Execution Module**

The overall framework will consist of three main components:

1. **Data Pre-processing**: This module will be responsible for preparing and cleaning the data, ensuring it is in the proper format for trading simulations.
2. **Trading Execution**: A class that will instantiate and execute trading strategies based on the pre-processed data. This component should be able to handle different types of trading strategies and ensure accurate execution of trades.
3. **Post-Trade Analysis**: After trading simulation, this module will analyse the returns and performance of the strategy. It will calculate various metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and generate visualizations to help in assessing the strategyâ€™s effectiveness.

## **Objective**

The objective of this assignment is to develop the "Trading Execution" class that can execute trading strategies based on pre-processed data and signals generated by a strategy builder function. Additionally, create a web interface that allows users to script and run trading strategies directly through a browser.

## **Part 1: Trading Execution Module**

Develop a Python class library with the following functionalities. Ensure the functions are modular:

1. **Strategy Builder Function**: Implement a function named `strategy_build` that identifies buy and sell signals using a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy (9-day SMA crossing over 20-day SMA). This function should update the DataFrame with a "signal" column indicating `-1` for sell, `1` for buy, and `0` for hold.
2. **Execution Function**: Develop a `run` function within the "Trading Execution" class that takes the cleaned DataFrame with SMA signals, along with the ticker name, start date, and end date as inputs. The function should:
   - Loop over the DataFrame index (as datetime) to:
     - Execute trades based on the SMA signals (`1` for buy, `-1` for sell, `0` for do nothing).
     - Implement nested `if-else` conditions using a `position` variable to store the current position and update it when conditions are met.
     - Store the trade open/close price. If it is a sell signal and a buy was made, calculate returns and store them in `df['returns'].iloc[i]`.
   - Implement a stop loss level of 5%.
   - Track and store returns in a time-indexed Pandas series.
   - Return the returns series to be used for post-trade analysis.

This code should be placed in a `trading.py` file.

## **Part 2: Web Interface**

Develop a web interface that allows users to:

- Input the ticker name, start date, and end date for running the trading strategy.
- View the signals and executed trades in a tabular format.
- Display the performance of the trading strategy, including cumulative returns and other relevant metrics.

Ensure that running `main.py` will serve the webpage locally, providing a user-friendly interface for scripting and executing trading strategies.

## **Final Submission Requirements**

1. **Code**: Submit a clean and well-documented `main.py` file that utilizes the modular code from your `trading.py` module.
2. **Web Development**: Include all necessary files to run the web interface.
3. **Demonstration Video**: Create a video (less than 5 minutes long) demonstrating the working code. The video should focus particularly on the web development aspects and explain how the interface was built and functions. Only one team member needs to present this part.
